	* new_network-conf.in, network.pl.in, parse.pl.in: completly new
	  network code and parsing routines.
	* network-conf.in: overwrote with new_network-conf.in and cvs
	  removing new_network-conf.in. Saving a backup, though.

	* be.pl.in: be_network_get_redhat now gives away more info. Same
	  should be done for debian and SuSE.
	* network-conf.in: be_ppp_get_phone_redhat is called from
	  be_network_get_redhat to obtain the phone pppd dials.

	* Changelog: fixed my revious wacky entry. 

2001-01-17  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@ximian.com>

	* network-conf.in: print and parse interface tags. Also bring up
	  or down network interfaces, and report their status when printing.

	* network-conf.in: network backend.
	* guess_system.sh: stolen from autoconf, a script to tell the
	system the backends are running on.
	* Makefile.am: install guess_system.sh where be.pl goes.
	* be.pl.in: need to replace ___scriptsdir___ here too, so I removed
	  be.pl and have this one for preprocessing.

	* memory-conf.in: Added debugging support. Got rid of hardcoded tool
	  locations, made it using be_locate_tool. Switched hardcoded 
	  /proc/meminfo to variable. Get all sizes in format %.1f to unify
	  with frontend.

	* time-conf.in (get_zone): when scanning for timezones
	only do a system "diff ..." if the file size matches the
	timezone we are looking for. This reduces loading time.

	* Added ChangeLog
