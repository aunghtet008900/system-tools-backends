# Konventioner:
#
#   boot -> start
#   firewall -> brandmur
#   gateway -> adgangspunkt
#   Gnome Setup Tools -> systemværktøjer
#   host -> vært
#   ID -> id
#   image -> aftryk
#   ISP -> [internet]udbyder
#   Local Interface Network -> lokalgrænsefladenetværk (RETMIG: rigtigt?)
#   location -> sted (drejer sig om et fysisk sted, fx en by)
#   option -> tilvalg (men dette er muligvis forkert i visse tilfælde)
#   parent location -> ophavssted
#   snapshot -> øjebliksbillede
#   startup -> start
#   swap -> swap (i mangel af bedre)
#   system configuration -> systemopsætningen, systemets opsætning (konfiguration bliver lidt tungt)
#   time server -> tidsserver
#
# Bemærk at mellemrum før : er fjernet, fx "Domain :" -> "Domæne:".
# Indstillinger er som regel bedre end håndtering som oversættelse af manager.
